**In this directory**: 
- I implement the variational autoencoder in the `VAE.py`
- Vectore-Quantized variational autoencoder in the `VQ_VAE.py`. The vq-vae has components spread from several files in the same directory. 
- The `hardcoded` folder includes priors that are not learnt but rather hard coded
